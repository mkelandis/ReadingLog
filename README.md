ReadingLog
==========

Parents can manage reading logs for kids using the bar code scanner.

Description
-----------

The app enables parents to manage reading logs of books for kids. Books can be scanned in via the barcode scanner on the phone. Book data is retrieved from a public Google API, including a thumbnail image of the book. A parent can store additional data about the book, including date, minutes read and whether the child read the book on their own, if they read it together or if the parent read it to the child. Additional information can also be entered as a comment. Then parents can e-mail an HTML report in order to print out the log to submit to the kids' teachers.

Multiple logs can be managed simultaneously.

It has been developed on Android 2.3 with a Droid X and compatibility-wise should work on any Android 2.1+ device with a camera. It relies on the zxing Barcode Scanner application to scan books. If you don't have that app, the phone should prompt you to download it the first time you attempt to scan a book. Book information can also be entered manually, in case the scan fails or there is no bar code (should be rare).

You'll need some books to scan. It should be pretty self-explanatory to get started, once the app is launched. You can also:

* long press a book in the log in order to add/edit book data or remove the book
* use the options menu to scan a book, enter book information manually, share the log, switch to a different log, create new logs, edit the name of the selected log or delete a log.

Note: An advert may display after sending the log.
